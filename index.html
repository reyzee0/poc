## 🛑 Subdomain Takeover – `shop.beta.starlink.com`

### 🔍 Description:
The subdomain `shop.beta.starlink.com` is delegated in DNS but is not currently bound to an active service in Fastly. When accessed, it returns a **known Fastly error page** indicating it is unclaimed:

> **Fastly error: unknown domain: shop.beta.starlink.com**

This behavior is documented as a common subdomain takeover vector ([GitHub Issue #22](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz/issues/22)).

### 💥 Business Impact:
If claimed by an attacker, this subdomain could be used to:
- Host phishing or fake pages under a trusted Starlink domain
- Harvest credentials or impersonate the Starlink brand
- Exploit trust in bookmarked or indexed URLs

---

### 📋 Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run a DNS query:
    ```bash
    dig CNAME shop.beta.starlink.com
    ```

2. Visit the URL:
    ```
    http://shop.beta.starlink.com
    ```

3. Observe the response:
    ```
    Fastly error: unknown domain shop.beta.starlink.com
    ```

4. This confirms the domain is **unclaimed on Fastly** and eligible for takeover.
